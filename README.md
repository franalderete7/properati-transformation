# Buenos Aires City Real Estate Dataset Transformation
This project is a part of the Acamica Institute in Buenos Aires.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to do a transformation of our data that was previusly explored and analysed. This is a continuation of the Exploatory Data Analysis project which can be found [here](https://github.com/franalderete7/properati-exploration).

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Cleaning
* Data Filtering

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Description
The dataset we'll be working with was extracted from Properati, just like the previus project. The objective is to delete NaN values and add new attributes based on existing ones using tools such us Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn in order to get a cleaner and more useful version of the dataset. We'll also remove outliers so our analysis is not biased. Finally, our dataset will be ready for regression.
